TMS Echo is a Delphi framework for data replication. It's part of TMS Business product line, and it's relies on TMS Aurelius to function. It allows you to have two or more databases and synchronize data between them. Changes you make to one client database (inserts, updates, deletes) can be sent to another database. It's bidirectional, so you can send and receive changes between databases.
